###USAGE

This is a text / messaging scenario which is useful for prototyping iOS text-based apps, creating a UX for a chatbot or any other reason you may have! Upload the files to a server and visit index.php for a demonstration. It is incredibly lightweight and I have documented the code throughout so it should be very easy to edit to your liking.

Feel free to use for Personal / Commercial use, just please give me a shout in the credits / message me so I know what you're doing, I love other people using my work! 

Originally developed to prototype a project of my own, I have now released this as my first official (yet tiny) open-source program.
